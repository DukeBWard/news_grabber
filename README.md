Using Goose, sqlc, Golang, Go Routines, Postgres

# Helpful notes:

* `sqlc generate` is really cool, will generate code in internal package based off of .sql files in sql directory.
* `goose up` and `goose down` migrations
* `goose postgres "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/news_grabber" up`
